abstract = {{Here, we present APPRIS (http://appris.bioinfo.cnio.es), a database that houses annotations of human splice isoforms. APPRIS has been designed to provide value to manual annotations of the human genome by adding reliable protein structural and functional data and information from cross-species conservation. The visual representation of the annotations provided by APPRIS for each gene allows annotators and researchers alike to easily identify functional changes brought about by splicing events. In addition to collecting, integrating and analyzing reliable predictions of the effect of splicing events, APPRIS also selects a single reference sequence for each gene, here termed the principal isoform, based on the annotations of structure, function and conservation for each transcript. APPRIS identifies a principal isoform for 85\% of the protein-coding genes in the GENCODE 7 release for ENSEMBL. Analysis of the APPRIS data shows that at least 70\% of the alternative (non-principal) variants would lose important functional or structural information relative to the principal isoform.}},

This property is of interest to molecular evolution as an explanatory factor of, e.g. evolutionary rate, as well as a functional feature which may in itself evolve. While many different methods of measuring tissue specificity have been proposed and used for such studies, there has been no comparison or benchmarking of these methods to our knowledge, and little justification of their use. In this study, we compare nine measures of tissue specificity. Most methods were established for ESTs and microarrays, and several were later adapted to RNA-seq. We analyse their capacity to distinguish gene categories, their robustness to the choice and number of tissues used and their capture of evolutionary conservation signal.}},

The transcriptomic signature of glutamatergic neurons in reptilian cortex suggests that mammalian neocortical layers are made of new cell types generated by diversification of ancestral gene-regulatory programs.

We profiled ∼1.3 million cells covering the entire adult mouse isocortex and HPF and derived a transcriptomic cell-type taxonomy revealing a comprehensive repertoire of glutamatergic and GABAergic neuron types. Contrary to the traditional view of HPF as having a simpler cellular organization, we discover a complete set of glutamatergic types in HPF homologous to all major subclasses found in the six-layered isocortex, suggesting that HPF and the isocortex share a common circuit organization. We also identify large-scale continuous and graded variations of cell types along isocortical depth, across the isocortical sheet, and in multiple dimensions in hippocampus and subiculum. Overall, our study establishes a molecular architecture of the mammalian isocortex and hippocampal formation and begins to shed light on its underlying relationship with the development, evolution, connectivity, and function of these two brain structures.}},

Among the two main branches of pre-trained language models in the general language domain, i.e. BERT (and its variants) and GPT (and its variants), the first one has been extensively studied in the biomedical domain, such as BioBERT and PubMedBERT. While they have achieved great success on a variety of discriminative downstream biomedical tasks, the lack of generation ability constrains their application scope. In this paper, we propose BioGPT, a domain-specific generative Transformer language model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical literature. We evaluate BioGPT on six biomedical natural language processing tasks and demonstrate that our model outperforms previous models on most tasks. Especially, we get 44.98\%, 38.42\% and 40.76\% F1 score on BC5CDR, KD-DTI and DDI end-to-end relation extraction tasks, respectively, and 78.2\% accuracy on PubMedQA, creating a new record. Our case study on text generation further demonstrates the advantage of BioGPT on biomedical literature to generate fluent descriptions for biomedical terms.}},

abstract = {{Functional loss of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein genetically and pathologically linked to ALS and FTD, leads to inclusion of cryptic exons in hundreds of transcripts during disease. Cryptic exons can promote degradation of affected transcripts, deleteriously altering cellular function through loss-of-function mechanisms. However, the possibility of de novo protein synthesis from cryptic exon transcripts has not been explored. Here, we show that mRNA transcripts harboring cryptic exons generate de novo proteins both in TDP-43 deficient cellular models and in disease. Using coordinated transcriptomic and proteomic studies of TDP-43 depleted iPSC-derived neurons, we identified numerous peptides that mapped to cryptic exons. Cryptic exons identified in iPSC models were highly predictive of cryptic exons expressed in brains of patients with TDP-43 proteinopathy, including cryptic transcripts that generated de novo proteins. We discovered that inclusion of cryptic peptide sequences in proteins altered their interactions with other proteins, thereby likely altering their function. Finally, we showed that these de novo peptides were present in CSF from patients with ALS. The demonstration of cryptic exon translation suggests new mechanisms for ALS pathophysiology downstream of TDP-43 dysfunction and may provide a strategy for novel biomarker development. Loss of TDP-43 function results in the expression of de novo proteins from mis-spliced mRNA transcripts.}},

We implement a statistical framework to quantify the contributions of 21 individual traits as drivers of gene expression and alternative splicing variation across 46 human tissues and 781 individuals from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We demonstrate that ancestry, sex, age, and BMI make additive and tissue-specific contributions to expression variability, whereas interactions are rare. Variation in splicing is dominated by ancestry and is under genetic control in most tissues, with ribosomal proteins showing a strong enrichment of tissue-shared splicing events. Our analyses reveal a systemic contribution of types 1 and 2 diabetes to tissue transcriptome variation with the strongest signal in the nerve, where histopathology image analysis identifies novel genes related to diabetic neuropathy. Our multi-tissue and multi-trait approach provides an extensive characterization of the main drivers of human transcriptome variation in health and disease.}},

abstract = {{Eukaryotic cells make many types of primary and processed RNAs that are found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cells. A complete catalogue of these RNAs is not yet available and their characteristic subcellular localizations are also poorly understood. Because RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of a cell’s regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a redefinition of the concept of a gene. A description is given of the ENCODE effort to provide a complete catalogue of primary and processed RNAs found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cell, revealing that three-quarters of the human genome can be transcribed, and providing a wealth of information on the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates and modifications of known and previously unannotated RNAs. These authors describe the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) effort to provide a complete catalogue of primary and processed RNAs found either in specific sub-cellular compartments or throughout the cell. They show that three-quarters of the human genome can be transcribed, and provide a wealth of information about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates and modifications of both known and previously unannotated RNAs.

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research. This overview of the ENCODE project outlines the data accumulated so far, revealing that 80\% of the human genome now has at least one biochemical function assigned to it; the newly identified functional elements should aid the interpretation of results of genome-wide association studies, as many correspond to sites of association with human disease.

The overall function of alternative splicing is to increase the diversity of mRNAs expressed from the genome. Alternative splicing changes proteins encoded by mRNAs, which has profound functional effects. Experimental analysis of these protein isoforms showed that alternative splicing regulates binding between proteins, between proteins and nucleic acids as well as between proteins and membranes. Alternative splicing regulates the localization of proteins, their enzymatic properties and their interaction with ligands. In most cases, changes caused by individual splicing isoforms are small. However, cells typically coordinate numerous changes in ‘splicing programs’, which can have strong effects on cell proliferation, cell survival and properties of the nervous system. Due to its widespread usage and molecular versatility, alternative splicing emerges as a central element in gene regulation that interferes with almost every biological function analyzed.}},

abstract = {{The genome-wide detection of alternative splicing and transcriptional initiation (ASTI) was conducted in six eukaryotes (human, mouse, fruit fly, nematode, cress and rice) whose genome sequencing has been completed or nearly completed. Transcriptional isoforms were collected by mapping a batch of full-length cDNA sequences onto the respective cognate genomic sequences. Isoforms mapped on the same gene locus were compared pair-wise, ASTI patterns were segmented into minimal spans, and then the minimal patterns (ASTI units) were classified into unique types, such as the cassette type or the alternative donor site. All these procedures were performed automatically under the same conditions so that the results obtained from different species could be compared directly. The fraction of loci that underwent ASTI of the total mapped loci was the largest for mammals and fruit fly, and the smallest for plants. Exactly the same trend was observed for the number of unique ASTI types found in each species. The observed fractional representations of the ASTI types were similar between evolutionarily close species, such as human and mouse or cress and rice. On the other hand, the relative orders of abundance in individual ASTI type were considerably different between evolutionarily distant species, such as between mammals and plants. In human and mouse, alternative splicing other than the retained introns tended to occur within the protein coding sequence (CDS) regions rather than within the untranslated regions (UTRs), whereas this tendency was obscure in the other four species. In all the species examined, the difference in alternative exon lengths was most likely in multiples of three, and this tendency was most prominent when the alternative exons were embedded within the CDSs. These observations are generally consistent with the idea that higher organisms utilize the ASTI mechanisms more extensively and in a more complicated manner than lower organisms, and that ASTI actively participates in the enhancement of the functional and structural diversity of products generated from a limited number of genes on a genome.}},

We have mapped and quantified mouse transcriptomes by deeply sequencing them and recording how frequently each gene is represented in the sequence sample (RNA-Seq). This provides a digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes. We report reference measurements composed of 41–52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3′ untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 × 105 distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.}},

We introduce here a working definition of conserved poly(A) sites as sites that are both (i) properly aligned in human and mouse orthologous 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and (ii) supported by EST or cDNA data in both species. We identified about 4800 such conserved poly(A) sites covering one third of the orthologous gene set studied. Characteristics of conserved poly(A) sites such as processing efficiency and tissue-specificity were analyzed. Conserved sites show a higher processing efficiency but no difference in tissular distribution when compared to non-conserved sites. In general, alternative poly(A) sites are species-specific and involve minor, non-conserved sites that are unlikely to play essential roles. However, there are about 500 genes with conserved tandem poly(A) sites. A significant fraction of these conserved tandems display a conserved arrangement of major/minor sites in their 3' UTR, suggesting that these alternative 3' ends may be under selection. This analysis allows us to identify potential functional alternative poly(A) sites and provides clues on the selective mechanisms at play in the appearance of multiple poly(A) sites and their maintenance in the 3' UTRs of genes.}},

Here we present an experimental reannotation of the GENCODE intergenic lncRNA populations in matched human and mouse tissues that resulted in novel transcript models for 3,574 and 561 gene loci, respectively. CLS approximately doubled the annotated complexity of targeted loci, outperforming existing short-read techniques. Full-length transcript models produced by CLS enabled us to definitively characterize the genomic features of lncRNAs, including promoter and gene structure, and protein-coding potential. Thus, CLS removes a long-standing bottleneck in transcriptome annotation and generates manual-quality full-length transcript models at high-throughput scales.}},

Two other human ARF cDNA sequences, designated human ARF1 and ARF3, have been reported previously and are 96\% identical in amino acid sequence. A human ARF1 cDNA, significantly longer than previously described clones, was obtained, by cross-species hybridization using a bovine ARF1 cDNA probe. Bovine ARF1p and human ARF1p are 100\% identical while each is only 80\% identical to hARF4p. Thus, hARF4p is the most divergent of the mammalian ARF proteins identified. Northern blot analysis revealed the expression of at least three different ARF messages in human placenta and adrenal carcinoma cells. Both hARF1 and hARF4 encode GTP-binding proteins with predicted molecular masses of 20,000-21,000 Da. Biochemical analysis of the purified recombinant proteins revealed a high degree of conservation of nucleotide binding properties and in vitro ARF activities. ARF is an essential gene in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and is encoded by two genes. Expression of either hARF1p or hARF4p in yeast was found to rescue the lethal double mutant, arf1-arf2-, thus demonstrating the functional conservation of ARF functions between yeast and man. The combination of in vivo and in vitro assays for ARF function provides a specific and unambiguous means of determining bona fide ARF proteins from divergent species from among the rapidly increasing number of structurally related, small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins.}},

Regulation of the elastin (ELN) gene occurs at multiple levels including promoter activation/inhibition, mRNA stability, interaction with microRNAs, and alternative splicing. However, these mechanisms are incompletely understood. Better understanding of the processes controlling ELN gene expression may improve medicine’s ability to intervene in these rare conditions, as well as to replace age-associated losses by re-initiating elastin production.

In this article we describe 177 different disease‐causing ACTA1 mutations, including 85 that have not been described before.

Biochemical and photobleaching data indicate that HA95 is tightly associated with chromatin and the nuclear matrix/lamina network in interphase, and bound to chromatin at mitosis. HA95 resides in a complex together with lamin B receptor (LBR), lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP)2 and emerin, integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane. Cross-linking experiments, however, illustrate a tight association of HA95 with LBR and LAP2 only. Intra-nuclear blocking of HA95 with anti-HA95 antibodies abolishes nuclear breakdown in a mitotic HeLa cell extract. The antibodies inhibit nuclear membrane breakdown and chromatin condensation - the latter independently of nuclear membranes. However, lamina disassembly is not affected, as judged by immunological analyses of A/C- and B-type lamins. In contrast, immunoblocking of HA95 bound to condensed chromosomes does not impair chromatin decondensation, nuclear membrane reassembly or lamina reformation. Our results argue for a role for HA95 in anchoring nuclear membranes and lamins to chromatin in interphase, and in releasing membranes from chromatin at mitosis. The data also suggest that HA95 is not involved in initial binding of membranes to chromatin upon nuclear reassembly. We propose that HA95 is a central platform at the chromatin/nuclear matrix interface implicated in regulating nuclear envelope-chromatin interactions during the cell cycle.}},

Using biochemical assays, we found that the N-terminal region of AKAP8L binds to mTORC1 in the cytoplasm. Importantly, loss of AKAP8L decreased mTORC1-mediated processes such as translation, cell growth, and cell proliferation. AKAPs anchor protein kinase A (PKA) through PKA regulatory subunits, and we show that AKAP8L can anchor PKA through regulatory subunit Iα. Reintroducing full-length AKAP8L into cells restored mTORC1-regulated processes, whereas reintroduction of AKAP8L missing the N-terminal region that confers the interaction with mTORC1 did not.

abstract = {{High-throughput sequencing of full-length transcripts using long reads has paved the way for the discovery of thousands of novel transcripts, even in well-annotated mammalian species. The advances in sequencing technology have created a need for studies and tools that can characterize these novel variants. Here, we present SQANTI, an automated pipeline for the classification of long-read transcripts that can assess the quality of data and the preprocessing pipeline using 47 unique descriptors. We apply SQANTI to a neuronal mouse transcriptome using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long reads and illustrate how the tool is effective in characterizing and describing the composition of the full-length transcriptome. We perform extensive evaluation of ToFU PacBio transcripts by PCR to reveal that an important number of the novel transcripts are technical artifacts of the sequencing approach and that SQANTI quality descriptors can be used to engineer a filtering strategy to remove them. Most novel transcripts in this curated transcriptome are novel combinations of existing splice sites, resulting more frequently in novel ORFs than novel UTRs, and are enriched in both general metabolic and neural-specific functions. We show that these new transcripts have a major impact in the correct quantification of transcript levels by state-of-the-art short-read-based quantification algorithms. By comparing our iso-transcriptome with public proteomics databases, we find that alternative isoforms are elusive to proteogenomics detection. SQANTI allows the user to maximize the analytical outcome of long-read technologies by providing the tools to deliver quality-evaluated and curated full-length transcriptomes.}},

abstract = {{Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a major mechanism that increases transcriptional diversity and regulates mRNA abundance. Existing computational tools to analyze APA have low precision because these tools are designed for short-read RNA-seq, which is a suboptimal data source to study APA. Long-read RNA-seq (LR-RNA-seq) accurately detects complete transcript isoforms with poly(A)-tails, providing an ideal data source to study APA. However, current computational tools are incompatible with LR-RNA-seq. Here, we introduce LAPA, a computational toolkit to study alternative polyadenylation (APA) from diverse data sources such as LR-RNA-seq and short-read 3’ sequencing (3’-seq). LAPA counts and clusters reads with poly(A)-tail, then performs peak-calling to detect poly(A)-site in a data source agnostic manner. The resulting peaks are annotated based on genomics features and regulatory sequence elements such as presence of a poly(A)-signal. Finally, LAPA can perform robust statistical testing and multiple testing correction to detect differential APA. We analyzed ENCODE LR-RNA-seq data from human WTC11, mouse C2C12 myoblast, and C2C12-derived differentiated myotube cells using LAPA. Comparing LR-RNA-seq from different platforms and library preparation methods against 3’-seq shows that LR-RNA-seq detects poly(A)-sites with a performance of 75\% precision at 57\% recall. Moreover, LAPA consistently improved TES validation by at least 25\% over the baseline transcriptome annotation generated by TALON, independent of protocol or platform. Differential APA analysis detected 788 statistically significant genes with unique polyadenylation signatures between undifferentiated myoblast and differentiated myotube cells. Among these genes, 3’ UTR elongation is significantly associated with higher expression, while shortening is linked with lower expression. This analysis reveals a link between cell state/identity and APA. Overall, our results show that LR-RNA-seq is a reliable data source for the study of post-transcriptional regulation by providing precise information about alternative polyadenylation.

While cost-effective and accurate for quantification, short-read RNA-seq lacks the ability to resolve full-length transcript isoforms despite increasingly sophisticated computational methods. Long-read sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) bypass the transcript reconstruction challenges of short reads. Here we introduce TALON, the ENCODE4 pipeline for platform-independent analysis of long-read transcriptomes. We apply TALON to the GM12878 cell line and show that while both PacBio and ONT technologies perform well at full-transcript discovery and quantification, each displayed distinct technical artifacts. We further apply TALON to mouse hippocampus and cortex transcriptomes and find that 422 genes found in these regions have more reads associated with novel isoforms than with annotated ones. We demonstrate that TALON is a capable of tracking both known and novel transcript models as well as their expression levels across datasets for both simple studies and in larger projects. These properties will enable TALON users to move beyond the limitations of short-read data to perform isoform discovery and quantification in a uniform manner on existing and future long-read platforms.}},

Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms. Results Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100 bp in length, ≥1 kb genomic reads at error rate ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3–4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.

With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio’s sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone.

However, the absence of a standard for clinical reporting and browser display complicates the process of consistent interpretation and reporting. To address these challenges, Ensembl/GENCODE1 and RefSeq2 launched a joint initiative, the Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) collaboration, to converge on human gene and transcript annotation and to jointly define a high-value set of transcripts and corresponding proteins. Here, we describe the MANE transcript sets for use as universal standards for variant reporting and browser display. The MANE Select set identifies a representative transcript for each human protein-coding gene, whereas the MANE Plus Clinical set provides additional transcripts at loci where the Select transcripts alone are not sufficient to report all currently known clinical variants. Each MANE transcript represents an exact match between the exonic sequences of an Ensembl/GENCODE transcript and its counterpart in RefSeq such that the identifiers can be used synonymously. We have now released MANE Select transcripts for 97\% of human protein-coding genes, including all American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Secondary Findings list v3.0 (ref. 3) genes. MANE transcripts are accessible from major genome browsers and key resources. Widespread adoption of these transcript sets will increase the consistency of reporting, facilitate the exchange of data regardless of the annotation source and help to streamline clinical interpretation. Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) delivers joint transcript sets from Ensembl/GENCODE and RefSeq for standardizing variant reporting in clinical genomics and research.}},

abstract = {{The RefSeq project at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) maintains and curates a publicly available database of annotated genomic, transcript, and protein sequence records (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/). The RefSeq project leverages the data submitted to the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) against a combination of computation, manual curation, and collaboration to produce a standard set of stable, non-redundant reference sequences. The RefSeq project augments these reference sequences with current knowledge including publications, functional features and informative nomenclature. The database currently represents sequences from more than 55 000 organisms (>4800 viruses, >40 000 prokaryotes and >10 000 eukaryotes; RefSeq release 71), ranging from a single record to complete genomes. This paper summarizes the current status of the viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic branches of the RefSeq project, reports on improvements to data access and details efforts to further expand the taxonomic representation of the collection. We also highlight diverse functional curation initiatives that support multiple uses of RefSeq data including taxonomic validation, genome annotation, comparative genomics, and clinical testing. We summarize our approach to utilizing available RNA-Seq and other data types in our manual curation process for vertebrate, plant, and other species, and describe a new direction for prokaryotic genomes and protein name management.}},

abstract = {{The GENCODE project annotates human and mouse genes and transcripts supported by experimental data with high accuracy, providing a foundational resource that supports genome biology and clinical genomics. GENCODE annotation processes make use of primary data and bioinformatic tools and analysis generated both within the consortium and externally to support the creation of transcript structures and the determination of their function. Here, we present improvements to our annotation infrastructure, bioinformatics tools, and analysis, and the advances they support in the annotation of the human and mouse genomes including: the completion of first pass manual annotation for the mouse reference genome; targeted improvements to the annotation of genes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; collaborative projects to achieve convergence across reference annotation databases for the annotation of human and mouse protein-coding genes; and the first GENCODE manually supervised automated annotation of lncRNAs. Our annotation is accessible via Ensembl, the UCSC Genome Browser and https://www.gencodegenes.org.}},
